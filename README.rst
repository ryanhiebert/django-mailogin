Django-Mailogin
===============

Django-Mailogin is a simple django app
to aid in passwordless email-based logins.
The idea is simple.
Most websites use a username and password
to authenticate their users,
but users don't do well at remembering their passwords,
so websites still have to provide some kind of
password reset functionality,
usually involving sending an email with a reset link.
This uses that reset link as the _only_ way to login.
